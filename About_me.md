Hi, I am John Hanna, a PhD student at Ecole Centrale de Nantes (ECN) in France. I am currently working in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).
I graduated from the American University in Cairo (AUC) with a BSc in Mechanical engineering (Summa Cum laude) in 2018. 
I finished a double degree MSc in Computational Mechanics between Polytechnical university of Barcelona and ECN in 2020.
I am developing python routines to solve forward and inverse problems and to explore PINNs, the newly developed technique.
